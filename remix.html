		<h1>Memo</h1>
		<p>The Remix Project was a project that we all put a lot of time into and had a lot of thinking that had to be done before any of the production of the documentary started. There were six areas that had to be given thought; these were composing in context, process, research, collaboration, project management and documentary design.</p>
		<p>Composing in context talks mostly about how the issue at hand affected the documentary and it’s design. Well because it was about shopping addiction we decided to do most of the shooting in the Macy’s at the mall. The reason for this was because we would need to videotape people shopping and this is the biggest clothing store in the Meridian Mall. Composing for this issue did help me understand this issue a little better. The reason for this is because as we were doing our filming I would frequently find myself looking around distracted by all of the clothes and not working as hard as I should have been. It really showed me that anyone could have an issue such as this. The biggest issue I found while we were making the documentary would be where to put some things. We were not always sure about what order we were going to put things in the documentary and I thought that was a little difficult because there would be conflicting viewpoints by some of the group members and to work that would was somewhat of a challenge.</p>
		<p>The second part was the process, how we picked the issue and how systematic the process was. We picked the issue by going through everyone’s cultural analysis project topics because we knew we wanted to do a documentary. Everyone named of theirs and the choices were like shopping addiction, the life of a lottery winner and two other really bad topics so the obvious choice here was shopping addiction. The hardest part about this was decided what direction we wanted to go from their. We knew our topic had to be shopping addiction but so what does that mean. Along with that I would have to say communication would have to be up their for the hardest part of the project. Given two kids from China and one from Zimbabwe they all had pretty heavy accents which made trying to hear what they had to say and what input they wanted to put in was quite a challenge. Because of this communication challenge I believe that our process was very systematic. We would meet for a day and only discuss what film we wanted, then we would meet another day and only talk about what graphics we wanted in the film, then was had an entire day of filming and another entire day of editing and finalizing the documentary. We had to get everything that was related to each other done in a day so that we could get all the kinks and knots out right then and there. </p>
		<p>The next part was the research part. The big site we used was storyofstuff.org. That is where we got most of our information and graphics for the video. The website that the group partner based his paper off of as well. The least effective research part was a CBS article that talked about the solutions. I just really didn’t like the solutions this article provided and decided to use a different website.</p>
		<p>The collaboration of this project was actually one of the more difficult aspects of this assignment. The language barrier is what really set my group apart from the rest of my class. In the beginning of this project it was hard to understand what my fellow group members were saying. As we progressed it became easier to work together and understand what was being said. Throughout this film everyone was willing to meet up at convenient times and locations. This made getting the documentary done on time very easy.  This project was quit fruitful. I was able to work with different cultures that were outside my comfort zone. It helped me understand what people from other countries are going through.</p>
		<p>Finding time to work on this paper was actually one of the easier aspects of this project. Having three of my group members live in east was very easy on planning time to work together. We were all able to meet at convenient, locations and times that met everyone’s needs. If I had more time to work on this project, I would have improved the qualities of a couple of my interviews. I would have had more time to improve the editing of my film along with the overall film itself.</p>
		<p>As far as my documentary goes, I would have to say that my graphics were the top aspect of this film. Being able to transition many small movie segments into one rather long film was very interesting. It was very beneficial and helped with my ability to use my own computer and it was the first time I had to use I movie.</p>
		<p>Overall, this project was a great learning experience and really broadened my horizons culturally. It was a lot of fun and really taught me a lot.</p>
