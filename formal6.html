			<p>The job outlook for actuaries is great. According to bls.gov, “Employment of actuaries is projected to grow 26 percent from 2012 to 2022” which is amazing. That 26 percent is more than double the increase for all occupations which will go up 11 percent according to this website. Actuarial Science is even much higher than computer and mathematical occupations, which will only go up 18 percent in the next ten years. That is amazing. Obviously actuarial science is a field with potential to grow and really have a force. This 26 percent increase means an increase of 6,300 jobs in the next years. According to this website there will be new healthcare laws and new risks that actuaries will have to take care of and because of that more actuarial jobs will be offered. This will be huge for the industry and increase the interest in people going into this field. In an interview with Brain Chadwick who is an advisor at Michigan State University for math and actuarial science majors he said that, “the field is growing right now, it is still the number one sought after position in the industry. There are a lot of openings right now and a lot of people are getting interested but because of that there may be a surplus of actuaries in the future. Because of that people need to figure out what they can do with their math skills if they don’t get a job as an actuary” when asked about weather or not the field of actuaries is growing, shrinking or staying the same. This could be very true. If a lot of people get interested in such a promising field and then too many people get interested there just won’t be enough room for everyone and that could be a problem. If this problem does arise then people planning on going into the field of actuarial science would have to think of a solid back up plan if they can’t find a job as an actuary quickly. The first thing that obviously jumps out is being a math teacher. However there are many other things you can go into having what is basically a math degree but not being an actuary. According to an article on collegeexpress.com many people with a math degree will go into some form of computer science and become a software developer. Another person became a data analyst. Or a different person went into engineering because of the heavy math background required for engineering. Along with all of this bls.gov suggests some similar occupations. Among these are Accounting, Budget Analysts, Cost Estimators, Economists, Financial Analysts, Insurance Underwriters, Mathematicians and Statisticians. However for Mathematicians and Statisticians they will need a Master’s degree. All of these though are great career options for anyone interested in math at all there are plenty of other options for actuarial science majors that can’t find employment fast enough.</p>
			<p>To be Frank Actuaries make a lot of money. The median wage for actuaries is $93,680 according to bls.gov. This is the number where half of all actuaries make more than this and half earn less than this. That is a pretty big number comparatively when the median wage for all occupations is $34,750 according to bls.gov. That is $58,930 more per year. That means that in ten years an actuary will make $589,300 more than the average person. That is a lot of dough. They even make $17,410 more than the median wage of a computer/ mathematics occupation, which is $76,270. Along with all of this the top 10 percent of actuaries make more than $175,330. That is a massive number that is only going to go up. The reason it will go up is because there are forecasts to be more risk in the future that will come up in the insurance business. Actuaries will need to deal with these risks and figure out the costs. Because they will need more actuaries that means that the demand is going up which will make the price of the service go up as well.<p/>
			<p>So after all of this great information how does someone become an actuary? That is a great question that will be answered right here. An actuary has quite some hoops to jump through. They must first go to a 4-year college and get a degree in a related field such as mathematics, statistics or actuarial science or a business related degree such as finance, economics or accounting according to careercornerstone.org. The major is not a huge deal as long as the person has great knowledge in calculus, statistics and probability. Some colleges that offer programs related to this career are Boston University, University of California Santa Barbra, Columbia University, Florida State University, University of Central Florida, University of Michigan and Michigan State University just to name a few. It would be in this individual’s better interest to take some business courses regardless of the major and to have great communication skills because of the talking that they do on a daily basis with the customers and higher ups in the company. According to the interview with Brain Chadwick he said that, “actuaries do a lot of one on one work with the customers and report directly to the high chairs of the company.” So they will want to have good communication skills. Along with the mathematics and communication background many actuaries are trying to become familiarized in the computer sciences. “Actuaries should be able to develop and use spreadsheets and databases, as well as standard statistical analysis software. Knowledge of computer programming languages, such as Visual Basic, also is useful.“ according to careercornerstone.org. For all of the presentations that actuaries must do a background in the computer sciences would be very helpful and in a few years probably necessary. On top of all of this schooling that actuaries must go through they must also pass a series of heavy exams that will give them the license. There are two companies that administer these exams and these two companies are the Society of Actuaries (SOA) and the Casualty Actuary Society (CAS). According to careercornerstone.org, “The Society of Actuaries (SOA) administers a series of actuarial examinations in the life insurance, health benefits systems, retirement systems, and finance and investment fields. The Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) gives a series of examinations in the property and casualty field, which includes fire, accident, medical malpractice, worker’s compensation, and personal injury liability.” So the Society of Actuaries is more if someone wants to go into the investment field and insurance field and the Casualty Actuarial Society is more for the specifics of dealing with the risks of damages either to someone’s home or at someone’s employment. The thing about these exams is that they are not easy by any means. According to beanactuary.com they recommend that people study 100 hours for every hour of the exam and that the first exam, the P/1 exam, is 3 hours long so they recommend that people study for 300 hours. That means that if all someone did was study instead of work , meaning they study for 8 hours a day everyday, it would take them 37 and a half days to fill up the 300 hours. If someone did this but took off the weekends it would take them 7 and a half weeks. That is almost 2 months. That is huge. These tests are a big deal. All together there are 5 exams that an actuary will take. That means 1500 hours of studying. That equates to 62.5 days of straight studying. The first two exams are the same no matter which way you choose to go, Society of Actuaries or Casualty Actuarial Society. Then the third one is different depending on which way you go and after that the fourth is again the same no matter what. “These initial examinations test an individual’s competence in probability, calculus, statistics, and other branches of mathematics. The first few examinations help students evaluate their potential as actuaries.” according to careercornerstone.org. So the first exam is to really test if you have what it takes to be an actuary and the second is to see how good you will be as an actuary. Along with this the plan for most people consists of them taking this first exam during their college career and will have to manage studying for it with all of there classes which are classes in the actuary field so they are not easy. This is why actuarial science is not for everybody. It is hard work. It takes a special kind of person that is able to do this and make some sacrifices some times to be able to follow this career path. Once someone is out of college and has passed at least one of the exams they will go work for what will most likely be an insurance company. They will work at the same time they will be studying for the next exam. Companies that hire actuaries will normally give actuaries an allotted amount of time per week to study instead of work. This allows them pass more exams and become better actuaries. They then get promoted and salary increase. Once an actuary has passes all of the exams they will reach an associate level and then Fellowship level. According to careercornerstone.org, “Most actuaries reach the Associate level within 4 to 6 years and the Fellowship level a few years later.” That’s pretty quick. So about 8 years after an actuary is out of college they are at a Fellowship level and about as high as they go unless they become an executive at the company. That is why so many people are interested in this career. It pays well in the beginning and by the time they are 30 they are as high as they can go. Then once someone reaches the top they can start to think about a family and settling down with someone that is nice and will care for them.<p/>
