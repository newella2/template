			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>This issue is incredibly prevalent in today’s world and it is ridiculous how many times I hear of a nice person that won the lottery and all of a sudden they are broke on the street with nothing to their name. I think I have come up with a perfect solution to the entire issue at hand. My solution is that every lottery winner must stay anonymous and under no circumstance should someone be able to find out who the winners of the lottery are. If no one ever finds out about who won the lottery then they can never hassle the person who won about giving them money. No more “that was my ticket” or “remember that time I washed your car.” All of that would be over and would allow each winner to be able to live a much simpler life after they win. Now to truly stay under wraps about winning I think that the person who won would have to stay low for a little while and no do any extravagant spending right away. This leads me to my second point. I think that everyone who wins should be forced to spend some of their winnings to go through a two-week class on how to spend large amounts of money wisely and how they should handle the entire situation. If people are put through a class on how to spend this large sum they could hide the fact that they just won the lottery easier and it would help with the fact of so many people that win the lottery go bankrupt months after they win. They would go to a two week class that would teach them all about the financials of the situation and because they would be the only one who won the lottery right then the class would be tailored to their situation. It would be perfect. Along with the two week class they would have regular counseling for 2 years and it would continue after that until the counselor decided that the winner was stable enough to be on their own. This counseling would be to make sure that the winner could handle his money correctly and would not commit suicide. Like I said earlier I have heard of lottery winners that commit suicide and that is so sad because they are given this great gift and then are just so overwhelmed with the scenario that they don’t know what to do with their lives so they end it. It is tragic. I believe that my solution has solved any issue that I see with a winner of the lottery.</p>
