			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>While being hysterical this episode really brings up an issue in society today that I think people should address. This same situation probably happens to thousands of people all around the world every year and I think that people should start to look at a solution. I mean what is the point of having a lottery if it is just going to make the person’s life worse? So next time you are at the story looking around while waiting in line and you see the sign that says, “Mega Millions: Next Jackpot $120 Million” really think to your self, “Should I buy those? Would it really lead to a better life?” and always remember that the lottery is a tax on people with poor math skills.</p>
