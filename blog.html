                <h1>blog entry 1</h1>
                <p>The purpose of this video is to try to show people how poorly people that are gay are treated.
                He does this by using examples of his uncle.
                His uncle was gay and his family treated him horribley leading him to shoot himself.\
                The whole video was him reading off a letter he wrote to his uncle about how it should get better and that his uncle has done a horrible thing by shooting himself.
                When his uncle shot himself he left this guy out to dry because he is now the only one in his family that is gay.
                He know has no one to go to with his problems. He has no shoulder to cry on now. His family basically hates him because he is gay. 
                His family treats him horribly even though he is not a bad person he just has different ideas.
                The way he structures his message is with a letter he is reading to his Uncle who is dead.
                It is more he is reading his letter to the public so that everybody can see what he wants to tell his uncle.</p>
                <p>The way that this can change my lived experiences project is that I think I should try to think of a better story.
                My story right now is pretty short and while it has good significance I don't think that it will suffice for such an essay.
                Also the story isn't a story that is only covered by a day it is like a sidestory that takes up a couple of years.
                I don't think I really like what I have choosen and I will change it as sooon as I think of something to change it to.
