                <p>The first week of Wra 110: Science and Technology was an eye opener for me. The teacher walks in and starts to go over what we will be doing that day and what should have been done prior to the class period which I, not so surprisingly, had not done. This is the first class in which most of the assignments are just posted online and where you have to be more proactive than just sitting back and waiting for the teacher to tell you what to do. That was the biggest lesson here. Learning to really be ready for whatever comes your way and to really be on top of what is due when and what you need to get done to be doing well in the class. This is only my second semester as a college student so I am sure there will be plenty more lessons such as this one that will come my way.  This is also the first taste of any programming or computer work like that, that I have ever done so that was kind of fun to get a different view on how websites are made into what they look like. It gives me a much greater appreciation for good websites that look nice and work well and smoothly.

                <p>The purpose of this video is to try to show people how poorly people that are gay are treated.
                He does this by using examples of his uncle.
                His uncle was gay and his family treated him horribley leading him to shoot himself.\
                The whole video was him reading off a letter he wrote to his uncle about how it should get better and that his uncle has done a horrible thing by shooting himself.
                When his uncle shot himself he left this guy out to dry because he is now the only one in his family that is gay.
                He know has no one to go to with his problems. He has no shoulder to cry on now. His family basically hates him because he is gay. 
                His family treats him horribly even though he is not a bad person he just has different ideas.
                The way he structures his message is with a letter he is reading to his Uncle who is dead.
                It is more he is reading his letter to the public so that everybody can see what he wants to tell his uncle.</p>
                <p>The way that this can change my lived experiences project is that I think I should try to think of a better story.
                My story right now is pretty short and while it has good significance I don't think that it will suffice for such an essay.
                Also the story isn't a story that is only covered by a day it is like a sidestory that takes up a couple of years.
                I don't think I really like what I have choosen and I will change it as soon as I think of something to change it to.

                <h1>blog entry 3</h1>
                <p>This week we learned how to build lists on to websites and code them. This coding stuff is really not as hard as thought it would be and is actually kind of fun. We also have the lived experiences project draft due on Wednesday at midnight. This was the project where we had to have a story about an object that had to do with our major. Within this project I learned that a calculator is really much more important than I thought it was. While I was doing this project I would think about all the times I use my calculator and it really was a lot more than I thought it was. Even for simple math like 7 times 8. It is much quicker to just plug that into a calculator than to do it in my head. It is really a time saver and I truly am glad that I have such a nice one that will do pretty much anything for me if I want it to.

                <p>This we have learned about tables and how to put them into a webpage. These can be very helpful when trying to organize things in a nice fashion. They can help group things together and show correlations between things. They really are a very helpful tool.  Along with learning this we have the lived experiences project due at midnight on Wednesday. This is our first real project that we have due in this class. The big thing I learned with this project was that I should really try to not let things get to the last minute to do them. This week I couldn’t help it with all of the things I had going on with Calculus two and Chemisty 141 which are two of the hardest classes offered here at Michigan State so it’s hard to not let things get to the last minute with these two however I have to try very hard to get things done early so they don’t become a huge nuisance. This is a big lesson. Time management here at college is huge and that is something I am just starting to grasp. This will only come with time but I am going to try to work on it with building a calendar and mapping out exactly when and where I am going to do everything.

                <h1>blog entry 5</h1>
                <p>This week we were introduced into CSS. This is a much easier way of making the design of a website or page look that way you want it to. With CSS you can group things together and then make the design of the whole group the way you want it. This is incredibly helpful to make it look like you actually know what you are doing and making your website presentable to the public and so it doesn’t look like everyone else’s. With CSS you have the ability to make your website truly your own and put your own twist on things. It is a great way to program. This week we were shown the cultural analysis project. It has to do with picking a piece of media such as a TV show, a movie, a song, even a music video. Pretty much anything and then we have to talk about the message that it brings up and the influence it may have on society as a whole. I am big into TV so I choose to find a show that may have a good meaning while being fun to watch with also the qualities of jumping to one random episode and still understanding what’s going on. For these reasons I tried to see if I could find a Family Guy episode that would have a good meaning. I was able to do so quite easily surprisingly. That is what I leaned this week. Everything can have a meaning if you look hard enough.

                <p>This week we have to finish the cultural analysis project and we were introduced to the formal research paper. The cultural analysis project went pretty well. It was pretty easy to connect the episode that I had chosen to a moral motto. It was all about winning the lottery and how most people just waste away all of the money they win within the first two years and are very bad at financial planning. They don’t understand that this is not going to be coming in often so if you buy a $50,000 boat then you have to find the money to pay for gas and repairs which really is a lot for a boat of that caliber. The general public doesn’t understand this. That was the big issue brought up in this episode. It even taught me a little because I often find myself getting money and right away going and spending it when I should be trying to save as much as I can for the future. This is something that I really should try to work on.

                <p>The people that were targeted in the video were gamers. People that just play video games all day and never do anything else.
                In my opinion the social issue at hand is that kids are spending too much time playing video games which have no significance in life and they don't do anything productive enough or get an excersice.
                The reason I thnk this is because throughout the episode the characters were getting fatter and fatter and the once guy convinced the guys who were playing basketball to stop doing that and only play video games for 3 weeks straight.
                I think that the maker of the episode was against video games because of the part where the Minecraft workers were like "no way I don't have an account, I actually have a life."
                That was a blow against people that do play vidoe games non-stop and clearly shows the creaters view point.

                <h1>blog entry 8</h1>
                <p>We have now been introduced into the formal research paper and have done the annotated bibliography. This is probably the biggest project of the entire class and will take a lot of time to get all of the research done. There is a lot of groundwork that must be done just to start about thinking of starting to write this paper. You have to find many scholarly articles and trade journal articles. These can be a pain to find some that have any relevance of what you think your project is going to be about. However this is how you learn about the subject on a level to write a paper such as long as the one given here. See there might be plenty of articles that are generally on the subject good but when you want to find one that can help support an argument that you are trying to make it can be rather difficult. There’s nothing that really can be done to fix this it just takes time to find all of the articles that you are looking for. That just takes hard work and that is what life is all about, hard work.

                <p>This week we have the formal research papers due and we start to look at the multimedia remix project. The formal research paper is very long and it is quite difficult to come up with an argument about actuarial science. I have basically turned my paper into a paper about why someone should become an actuary while also showing some of the drawbacks to becoming one. This was a pretty easy argument to make. The reason for this is because the field of actuaries is growing rapidly and they have a great quality of life. The one big drawback is the difficulty of becoming one. However once you become an actuary you are golden. Pretty much guaranteed a job and a great income. I am very excited about this possibly being my future career. The big thing I found out with this project though was how hard it really is to become an actuary. I didn’t think it would be that difficult to pass the exams that they have to pass but from what I hear it is quite difficult to pass these exams and become an actuary. This is big because it means that I will have to study a lot more than I thought I was going to have to.

                <p>This is the first week that we are working on the multimedia remix project. This is a very interesting project. We have to make a documentary about a subject that one of us wrote about earlier in the class. My group is a bunch of foreign exchange students so it was a bit of a challenge to talk to them about what we were going to do our project on. However I was able to talk to them enough to pick a subject that one of the exchange students wrote about which was shopping addiction. This I thought was an odd subject to start but it grew with me over the course of the week as we began planning what we were going to do in the project. It will be easy to get shots of us shopping and doing other activities that are related to shopping so I think this project will work out well within our subject.

                <p>The Chrysler Imported from Detroit ad is one of the greatest advertisements in Super Bowl history. It got amazing numbers. The number one thing that I believe contributed to this is the voice over. The narrator in this commercial really puts across a gritty theme and fits perfectly with what the commercial is trying to do. Overall what the commercial is trying to do is to get people to look at buying a Chrysler 200 automobile. They do this by showing that Detroit is a hard working town that is all about getting stuff done. The imagery of Detroit really drives this point home with how they show all of the factories and how gritty and grimy it is. Then they throw in the “Imported from Detroit” line. All of this combines to make a statement that Detroit is like no where else in the world and because of this a Chrysler car will be like nothing else that you will find therefore you should check them out which is exactly what they are trying to do.

                <p>The final retrospective project was introduced this week and we continued to work on our remix project outside of class. Our project is going pretty well. I am rather surprised at how well these foreign exchange students transition into the American schooling system. Also I never would have guessed that Michigan State University had students from Zimbabwe. That was a big surprise to me. That is the big lesson here; how different other cultures are and how well they transition into the American culture. When the group met to work on the project in Akers I was sitting there wondering why all of these kids decided to go to an American University instead of staying in their home country. That was one of the first questions that I asked all of them and then the conversation transitioned into how bad the schools in China and Zimbabwe are and some of the struggles that these foreign exchange students are having. Then they started to ask me about what life here in America is like. It was truly a great cultural eye opening experience for me and I believe that I have been changed for the better because of the group that I was given for this project.

                <p>This week the Remix project was due at midnight on Wednesday along with the retrospective project draft due in class. The retrospective project was basically about what we had learned all year. This is a pretty easy project because all you have to do is to say what a incoming freshman would want to hear before each project and because I have complete all of these you just have to give one general tips for each project that would help them write each paper. The big thing I learned here was how much we have really accomplished in just one semester of college. It didn’t feel very long but we really have accomplished a lot such as creating a website, creating a blog and writing/making 4 major papers or projects. It is crazy to think how much you can get done in such a short period of time as long as you put in the work and time required to great things. That I think is the biggest thing I have learned this semester not only in WRA but form all of my classes. Hard work goes a long way and can really get you anywhere you want to go as long as you want to be there. I will always remember that.

                <p>This week we are just working more on the retrospective project. Because of this there really isn’t much to say about this week so I will go more into this hard work thing that I spoke of earlier. Hard work is required to do great things. Graduating college is a great thing to accomplish and it is really just now starting to hit me about how much work is really going to have to be put into this for me to be able to succeed and accomplish the things I want to accomplish. The way I see it though is that there is nothing worth having in this world that comes easy. See anyone can just float through life everyday and just “get through” everyday. I don’t want that to be me. I want to flourish everyday and become someone that everyone wishes they were. That is my real goal in life, to be someone that everyone looks up to and to have the work ethic of a machine. Someone who will never stop for anything. That is what life is all about for me.

                <p>With this being my last post most likely forever because I really doubt I am going to revisit this blog and keep posting in it once this class is over. This is also finals week so obviously the class is coming into the wind down. With that I will put what I have learned overall within the whole class. Honestly I never would have guessed this but the big lesson here for me would be to always keep an open mind to everything. To start I never thought I would like any part of programming or anything like that and I didn’t really mind learning about it and making my own website. If you had told me that at the beginning I would have called you crazy and blown you off like you were the stupidest person I have ever met. Along with this when I was given my group for the remix project I really thought I was screwed. I thought there was no way that with two Asians and a kid from Zimbabwe we were going to make a decent documentary let alone a good one. Well I was proven very wrong. Mengzhen, one of the Asians, was a great cameraman and had some of the best ideas in the group which I never would have guessed. Now some of the acting wasn’t great but that is what made the video kind of funny and you really couldn’t expect much more out of these guys. After being through this I will try to always have an open mind to everything and try to judge everything to an absolute minimum.
