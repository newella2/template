			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Writer Andrew Goldberg did a fantastic job of creating a story perfectly depicting the life of a recent lottery winner when he wrote “Lottery Fever” for Family Guy in season 10. The episode had all of the major issues. It had references to the begging from friends when in the episode Joe, Quagmire and Peter are at the bar and Joe and Quagmire talk about how good of friends they are with Peter and they start to hint at the fact that it would be really nice to have some extra cash. This is a clear reference to the nagging that lottery winners get after they win the lottery. He makes this pretty obvious because of the timing and wording. The scene is minutes after Peter finds out that he won the lottery and Joe and Quagmire never say directly that they need money they just talk about the unfortunate situation they are in and how some extra money would help. Peter then takes the liberty of giving them money. Once Peter gives Quagmire and Joe the money the episode does a good job of displaying the greed people posses in todays society. They do this when Quagmire and Joe try to leave the bar and Peter is not ready so Peter basically tells them to sit back down because he just gave them some money. Then Peter makes Joe watch the first season of True Blood and show Peter any scene that has boobs in it. Peter is too lazy to watch the show himself so he makes Joe do it just because he has given him a little money. Then he makes both Quagmire and Joe go to an auditorium of some sort and dance around while he shoots them. He basically acts like he owns them from the moment he gave them the money. Another good example of this is the rest of the family, Chris uses glue to get high because according to him, “you don’t see poor people doing this” and Stewie builds a huge mobile on top of the house so that he can go to bed anywhere and Louis is given a huge blood diamond ring. She was complaining that Peter wasn’t spending the money right until he gave her this ring and then asked him if the diamond was a blood diamond. As soon as she got something out of the money she didn’t care at all how Peter spent the money. This is exactly what a real person would do and I applaud the writer for making this a part and truly showings us how greedy we really are. The other issue this episode addressed was the blowing through all of the money. It takes Peter like 3 days to blow through $150 million dollars. For most people this would be able to last a lifetime if not more and they would be able to pass it down to their children but no Peter being the man he is decides to spend it so wisely with all these outrageous items and memberships that he spends all of his money rather quickly. He goes to pay for something with his credit card and it is denied thus ending his reign and forcing him to sell everything he bought and having to drop the country club membership. </p>
