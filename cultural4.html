			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The minute someone wins the lottery their life will be changed forever weather they like it or not. Everyone and their mothers will be asking this person for money for every little favor they have done and just expecting money from them because they won the lottery. Everyone just assumes that because this person can now buy basically whatever they want that they will buy everyone else whatever they want too. They will just go to the lottery winner and say “oh you remember that one time when I drove your kid home from school because you wouldn’t make it in time yeah well know since your rich and all. Can I have a new boat?“ Along with the general public asking for money there is always some dispute in the family about some senseless reason why the money really belongs to the winner’s uncle or something like that. Such disputes include that the uncle originally bought the ticket then gave it to the winner as a gift but then won and now the uncle would like the ticket back along with the winnings. Or the winner’s mother loaned money to the winner so she believes that the winnings should be hers because under some circumstances you could make a case that it was her money that bought the ticket. Then on top of random harassers and family members asking for money most people that win the lottery waste all of the money away on absurd objects. Instead of spending the money wisely and paying off bills, mortgages, debts or anything of that sort they go out right away and buy the most marvelous belongings they can think of and just assume everything will work it self out. Society as a whole is stupid this way. They get way too worked up about how much money they have just obtained and believe that it is basically never endless which is far from the truth. I know all too well the feeling of having an endless supply of money and how fast it can just disappear. Another issue that comes to people that win the lottery is that they become very greedy and just expect that because they have a ton of money now that people will just do whatever the winner wants no questions asked. See people are already greedy in society. That is why people play the lottery; because people want to be rich but they don’t really want to work for it they just want it to come to them. Then as soon as someone wins the lottery that greed basically triples. They want everything along with everyone to do everything for them. It truly is quite ridiculous. This greed is a big reason why people waste away all of their money as soon as they win. They have no sense of how much they really have and try to buy everything all at once. Along with all of these bad things that I have already mentioned some people argue that the life expectancy of a lottery winner is shorter. This is due to the fact the some lottery winners can’t handle the winnings and commit suicide, or at least try, and some are killed by other people because the other people want the money. Some people when they are done wasting away all of their money realize what they have done and can’t live with themselves; so they kill themselves. Other times people that didn’t win are so mad and greedy that they try to kill the winner and take the money.</p>
