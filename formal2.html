			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Risk is everywhere in the world, risk is in everything you do, you may just not see it in everyday life. When you go out to the store, there is a risk that you will get hit by an egg thrown by a provoked teenager influenced by his peers as youâ€™re rolling down the road, or hit by another car from another driver that is currently on the phone yelling at his boss because he just got fired. There are certain people that determine some of these risks and those people are called actuaries. Most of them study the field of actuarial science and even fewer study that here, at Michigan State University. Well now what exactly is actuarial science and what do actuaries do? That is what this essay will go into depth about. It will enlighten you about what actuary science is, along with how technology helps this career path. It will explain what the job outlook will look like in the future and, how they do economically, and how someone becomes an actuary.</p>
