		<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
		<p>Writing, Rhetoric and American Cultures 110: Science and Technology has been a big learning experience for me in the journey that I call my freshman year. Throughout this second semester in this Writing, Rhetoric and American Cultures class we have done 5 big projects including this one right here. I will be doing a review and a little tips for the new kids on each of these five projects which include the Lived Experiences Project, the Cultural Analysis Project, the Formal Research Project, the Multimedia Remix Project and the Course Retrospective Project which is this right here.</p>
		<p>The Lived Experiences Project was about all about a piece of technology that you have used in your life and how it had to do with your major. You also had to have a story about the piece. This was probably my least favorite project. I didn’t really have any good stories about anything that had to do with actuarial science. That was the problem. I had a piece of technology that had to with my major and I had a major but no story. So I ended up using a really lame story that actually happened. It was not an exciting piece of writing but they can’t all be good, that’s what makes the good ones special. My story was about how my calculator was the big piece of technology that led to my major decision. The reason was because my major has a lot of math to do with it and a calculator is obviously a tool used in a math class. This made it pretty easy to link back to my major pretty much just giving me the task of getting a story. This I did about how my father made a deal with me about if I keep my calculator throughout my entire high school career my father would buy me a brand new laptop computer to use in my college career.</p>
		<p>The second project, the cultural analysis project was pretty fun too. The objective of the project is to find a piece of media, TV show, movie, song, anything and then talk about its cultural meaning and the issue it is trying to bring forward. This project was pretty fun because it gives you a ton of freedom on what you are allowed to pick then just find something to talk about in it. I know a guy who picked a YouTube video talking about shopping addiction. It can be that easy. However I chose to have a little fun with this and chose to go a different route. I chose a Family Guy episode. The episode was about when Peter wins the lottery and then all the stupid stuff he does with the money he wins. So for a project I got to watch family guy. It was pretty awesome. My big tip here is pick something that you will want to watch because you will have to watch it multiple times to make sure you get down all the key parts. I think I had to watch that entire episode three times. Also really try to have fun here. Like the guy I know, does he really care about shopping addiction, absolutely not but it made his project a little easier so he used it. I can guarantee he did not have a fun time writing that paper. Did I have fun? Absolutely, I had to try to twist a real moral lesson out of a family guy episode which I did quite successfully I might add. </p>
		<p>The third project your major that you have chosen. This was by far my favorite and the project where I learned the most. This project was awesome. You get to research the major you have chosen which for most people the field they plan on going into. Why would you not want to learn more about the field you are going into? Well for me that field was Actuarial Science. I knew a little about what I was getting my self into but I didn’t know a whole lot. Boy did I learn a lot. I read up on every actuary website I could find, the field isn’t that big so there weren’t very many. I now know everything there is to know about actuarial science and really have a good understanding of what it really takes to be successful in this field and what it is all about. Along with looking at a description of the major you’re supposed to find a piece of technology that helped you come to the conclusion about what major you have chosen. This was easy. Say a computer. Computers are so important in today’s world that a computer can work for literally every major that any school offers. You use a computer everyday and for pretty much everything in your life, even if you don’t realize it you really do. For the experience with this piece of technology part if you don’t really think a computer helped you that much just say that “you found your major on the school’s website then looked it up with a computer” which really did happen with me but anyone can say that and no one would ever question it. </p>
		<p>The Multimedia Remix Project was the fourth project. This was pretty fun. The project was to make a documentary about one of the group member’s project. We chose to do our project on shopping addiction. Honestly it was pretty fun to make a documentary about shopping addiction. My group consisted of three foreign exchange students and me. Needless to say they were not great actors because all of them had pretty strong accents. That is what made this project fun. When we were “acting” they were not the greatest, which made watching the movie pretty funny. The movie turned out pretty good but it took quite a bit of effort and time that we put in. We had to go to the mall to tape some of the film, which was kind of funny because we had to do some of the acting in public. We decided to do most of the filming in a Macy’s because it had to do with shopping addiction. I almost found a little addict inside of me as I was looking at clothes while we were supposed to be filming. This I found to be a little ironic. The big thing here I would advise to anyone doing a project such as this would to be to start early. The filming can take quite a bit of time and if you try to rush the whole project in the last days you will not get all of the filming done and your film will look horrible thus getting you a bad grade. Also I would suggest contacting your group early so you can get a good feel on what everyone should be doing and what the project will ultimately look like.</p>
		<p>The final project is this one right here. It is a project to look back on all of the previous projects you have done. It is not a particularly hard project you just pretty much give a review on what you did in each project and give a tip or two to someone that might have to do a project that would be similar to the one done by myself. The bad thing is that the second part of this project is to make this whole paper into a website. I have no idea how hard this will be but I assume it will not be incredibly difficult. This brings me to my big tip. When you start this class you will learn that there is a lot of stuff that needs to get done each week that the teacher doesn’t really talk about. This stuff includes reading a book about how to write research papers and a programming tutorial. The big tip is to make sure that you keep up with this programming tutorial. Each week make sure that you look at what must be completed and what you have to learn. In the beginning of the year I didn’t know that we had to be doing this. I fell way behind on this a it was really hard to catch myself up from this and it took almost an entire day to catch up however if you do this according to the schedule it really won’t take a lot of time. That is why I highly advise keeping up to date with all of this. As long as you do this it won’t be any kind of problem and along with that you will learn how to program which is pretty cool and possible even something you could put on your resume. </p>
		<p>Overall, this year has gone by very quickly and has been quite an adventure. Before any of my other tips I would say to just have fun here because you only get to do life once and you don’t want to be looking back and wondering what if.</p>
