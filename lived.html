		<h1>Don't Lose the Calculator</h1>
		<p>It all started in middle school. My father bought me a TI-84 Plus Silver Edition Texas Instruments Calculator. This was a big deal for my siblings and me. This calculator was very nice and can pretty much do anything you ask it as far as math goes. It can graph functions as well as figure out derivatives to functions, which is incredibly helpful once you get to calculus. You see I have been in honors math my whole life so as soon as they said that I should buy a calculator my dad immediately found the nicest and most expensive one that he could find. That happened to be this calculator. All I probably needed was a simple calculator that could do basic actions but my dad being the person he is had to go overboard. His theory was that “if you were good with numbers then you could find a job anywhere” so he always wanted me to be good at math. He didn’t push it on me or anything but he put keys there to help me succeed in mathematics. I did just that. I went through high school and breezed through math. I never had issues with it and I never and I mean never studied. I was one of the smartest kids in my class always and I was always the kid that would help everyone else that didn’t get it. I credit some of this success to my calculator that my father bought me when I was young and because of this success I choose a major in Actuarial Science.</p>
		<p>When my dad bought me this calculator he was very worried that we weren’t going to take it very seriously, mess around with it and not take very good care of it. To fix this he made a deal with all three of us that if we never lost the calculator and it still worked by the graduation that he would buy all three of us a brand new computer of our choosing for college. This did exactly what he wanted. All three of us cherished these calculators because we knew what they would turn into after high school. I mean I did anything to make sure this calculator was not in harms way. It was always either in my locker locked up or in my backpack with its on pocket with things around it protecting it from any falls the backpack may have in case I forget that its in there and swing the backpack down off my back. Whenever I used it I would make sure that as soon as I was done with it I would put it directly back in my backpack to make sure that I wouldn’t leave it anywhere leaving a chance that someone may take it and making me lose the deal. See this would be horrible because I have had my own computer since I was in the 3rd grade. I basically need a computer to live and the one I had in high school would not be good enough to last me through college. This means that I would have to buy a new computer and that would have been a huge chunk out of my bank account that I don’t think I could’ve handled. Because of this I made sure to always take great care of this massive calculator.</p>
		<p>There was one time when this was not so true… It was in my senior year of high school. I had done a great job of keeping this calculator safe up until this point and I was in the home stretch just trying to finish the year and move on to college. Well my senior year I was taking physics and in physics I did a lot of complicated math that involved a calculator. I had a pretty bad teacher that year who would just send us to the back of the room where there were computers and we would do labs on them while he would sit at his desk in the front of the room and play games on his iPad. He really was quite bad, but anyway so I was doing some sort of lab on a computer and I was in a group with my brother and two of our friends. One of our partners and I would do all of the work most of the time while my brother and his now roommate would sit there get the answers after we were done. The partner wasn’t very good at math so I would do most of the calculations while she would get the general concepts down. Because of this I would always use my calculator. Well one day I must have left my calculator on the back table because I went home and I was trying to do some math homework and I rummaged through my backpack and I just could not find it. I freaked out. I was yelling at everyone in my house trying to find this calculator, I even freaked out at my mother. That was when I realized how much this deal really meant to me. I was yelling at my mom because I couldn’t find a calculator that was my responsibility. Because I cherished this calculator so much I think it made me like math that much more, along with the fact that I am so good at it.</p>
		<p>Because of my immense skill and enjoyment for math I came into college knowing that I wanted to do something with math. At first I wanted to be engineer like my father but I think that was just because that is what my dad did. Then I got into stocks and I wanted to get into business while still doing something with math. So when I got here to Michigan State I talked to Helen Dashney who is the head of company relations in the Finance Department. She told me that I should look at Actuarial Science and I did just that. After looking at it I loved it. It was all math with some business influences. It’s great. A lot of people don’t know what Actuarial Science is so I will explain it here. Actuarial Science is determining the risk of insurance and investments. So as an actuary I might be given a 55 year old male who doesn’t smoke and has no fatal diseases and have to determine when he is most likely to die or I will be given a stock and have to say what is the risk that it might plummet and what are the chances that it will sky rocket up. To be an actuary you first have to take two Actuary Exams and the first one is three hours for 30 multiple-choice questions. It is recommended that you study for 300 hours before taking the exam and the first time you go through a practice exam you won’t even get through half. They are meant to be very challenging so that only people that are truly meant for this will get through. After these first two exams there are three exams on both sides for insurance or investments. So altogether I will have to take 5 exams.</p>
