			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>If all of my plans are put into effect I believe that there would be tremendous changes in the lives of winners. First, the percentage of lottery winners that end up blowing all of their money in the first two years of having it would greatly decrease. If they are given a class on how to manage their money correctly and are shown what can happen if they don't they will get scared of losing all this money and would be smarter with it. Second, the deaths of lottery winners would go down by a ton. With the counseling to make sure they are doing ok none of them would commit suicide and if they are kept anonymous then no one will know who won so they can't kill the winner because they won't know who it is.</p>
