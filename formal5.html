			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
			<p>Technology is a huge part in a career path as one of actuarial science. They use computers everyday in every activity they do. Most of the presentations actuaries have to do use spreadsheets and Microsoft excel. With excel they can easily plug in numbers to a chart that they have made and change numbers around with no problem at all. They can type in a formula they would like come up with and what numbers go where in that formula and just plug everything in. It really makes heavy math much, much easier. Technology has changed the whole world in this way, making math presentations much faster and easier. If actuaries had to do presentations by hand they would have draw out each chart by hand and then if they messed up a number somewhere or a calculation they would have to re-draw the whole thing. That would take up so much of their company time and waste and resources or worse the company would have pay someone else to draw out these charts and that would just be wasting company funds and decrease the bottom line. Thatâ€™s just bad business. Clearly technology has been a huge part there but also in the calculations technology has been an even bigger help. In todays world someone can make a program on a calculator and all someone will have to do is plug in the numbers they want for each variable and the calculator solves the equation for them. If people had to do this by hand there probably would not be a job for an actuary. By the time someone would finish with a project the project would be useless and they would have to start working on the next thing. Everything they would do would just be one big waste and companies would not want to waste company funding on such a unwanted service when it helps them literally none. So someone could even say that not only did technology help this career flourish it created it or made it possible. </p>
