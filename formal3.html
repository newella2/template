			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>According to Investopedia.com the definition of actuarial science is “A discipline that assesses financial risks in the insurance and finance fields using mathematical and statistical methods. Actuarial science applies the mathematics of probability and statistics to define, analyze and solve the financial implications of uncertain future events. Traditional actuarial science largely revolves around the analysis of mortality and the production of life tables, and the application of compound interest.” So what exactly does that mean? What that means is that actuarial science is to determine risk on a certain event using mathematical data and statistics. They are also supposed to figure out what is the cost of such a risk.
Someone is given some data and is told to figure out what is the likelihood that a certain event will happen such as, what is the likeliness of 35 year old male who smokes and has no serious illnesses will die before the age of 60? They are given statistics on the odds of a smoker dying at 60, of males dying at 60 and 35 year olds with no illnesses dying at 60 and combine all of those numbers to give the insurance company a number. Then they figure out that if this person dies what does that mean for the company, what does it cost the company? After they have all of this information they are then responsible to make a plan for the company as to how the company should reduce this cost associated with risk as much as possible. They must keep up with these plans and “will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis.” according to an article from careercornerstone.com. On top of all of this actuaries have to be able to present to the company and customers. In an interview with Amy Evron who is an Actuarial Analyst at Tower Watson in the Detroit office’s Retirement line of business when asked “What made you want to be an actuary?” she said that, “she always really liked math but she wanted something that had a good social side to it” and that “being an actuary was the perfect combination.” See, actuaries are a special breed of people that not only are math wizzes but can also hold a solid conversation with someone and are not super awkward.
