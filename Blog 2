                <p>The people that were targeted in the video were gamers. People that just play video games all day and never do anything else.
                In my opinion the social issue at hand is that kids are spending too much time playing video games which have no significance in life and they don't do anything productive enough or get an excersice.
                The reason I thnk this is because throughout the episode the characters were getting fatter and fatter and the once guy convinced the guys who were playing basketball to stop doing that and only play video games for 3 weeks straight.
                I think that the maker of the episode was against video games because of the part where the Minecraft workers were like "no way I don't have an account, I actually have a life."
                That was a blow against people that do play vidoe games non-stop and clearly shows the creaters view point.
